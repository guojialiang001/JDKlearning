     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}

     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface

     * {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or
     * some other thread interrupts the current thread, or a certain
     * amount of real time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * This method is similar to the {@code wait} method of one
     * argument, but it allows finer control over the amount of time to
     * wait for a notification before giving up. The amount of real time,
     * measured in nanoseconds, is given by:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * 1000000*timeout+nanos</pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * In all other respects, this method does the same thing as the
     * method {@link #wait(long)} of one argument. In particular,
     * {@code wait(0, 0)} means the same thing as {@code wait(0)}.

     * releases ownership of this monitor and waits until either of the
     * following two conditions has occurred:
     * <ul>

     *     to wake up either through a call to the {@code notify} method
     *     or the {@code notifyAll} method.
     * <li>The timeout period, specified by {@code timeout}
     *     milliseconds plus {@code nanos} nanoseconds arguments, has
     *     elapsed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the
     * monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
     * possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {
     *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
     *             obj.wait(timeout, nanos);
     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.
     *
     * @param      timeout   the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.
     * @param      nanos      additional time, in nanoseconds range
     *                       0-999999.
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException      if the value of timeout is
     *                      negative or the value of nanos is
     *                      not in the range 0-999999.
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of this object's monitor.
     * @throws  InterruptedException if any thread interrupted the
     *             current thread before or while the current thread
     *             was waiting for a notification.  The <i>interrupted
     *             status</i> of the current thread is cleared when

     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
